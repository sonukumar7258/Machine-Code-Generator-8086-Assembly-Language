# Machine-Code-Generator-8086-Assembly-Language
Implemented assembler which converts x86 assembly code into machine understandable code (Binary) by getting Opcode and other things as well


Pre-requisites to run the Code:

- Visual Studio (Recommended 2019 version)
- No need to do any Assembly Configuration

You have to simply unzip the coal_project File and open on provided visual studio and simply run it, when you run it is asking for assembly instruction, and 
in output it will return the machine code in binary or hexcode, the code which machine understands for that assembly instruction
